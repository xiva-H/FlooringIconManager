## WelcomeScreen
When the users open the app, they are greeted with a welcome screen titled with FlloringIconManager. Customers can search floor by category or search floor by name by clicking on search. Employees can log in using the account (i.e. Username: admin Password: admin) button from the top right corner to search, add, edit, and delete product. You may also scroll up and down to have a better picture of the Laminate.

## Search Product
Customers can search for a product by entering the product name and when employees log in they also have the option to search product by name. Both customers and employees have the option to choose the store by selecting from the drop-down menu under all store locations and choose the floor type by selecting from the drop-down menu under all floors. Both customer and employees may search by any field filled out as long as its equal to or greater than 1 field filled out.

If the user chooses floor type as wood two other options (all wood types and all wood species) come up where they can choose the wood types and species. It will be the same for other floor types as well. Selecting a floor will reveal its sub lists.

When searching this method, the search by name will look for anything that's matching the product name or the product brand as shown below:

 ## Add Product

The employee then will add the fields for the product to have. No field can be left blank. The system will urge the user to fill in all blanks.

The screen is similar to the search screen, as an employee would have to search for the product they want to edit first. In this example the employee is going to look for all Ceramic Tiles in store 1003.

Once the product comes up employees can click on click product to edit in order to edit the information of the product which brings up a new screen.
